# Repository Name: Circuit Designs with LABVIEW

## Introduction
Welcome to the Circuit Designs with LABVIEW repository! In this repository, you'll find a collection of circuit designs for various modulation techniques, including Double Sideband-Full Carrier, Double Sideband-Suppressed Carrier, Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK). These designs were created using the LABVIEW software, providing an interactive and visual way to understand and simulate these modulation methods.

## Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)
In this section, you'll find the LABVIEW circuit design for Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM). PAM is a digital modulation technique used to transmit analog signals by varying the amplitude of pulse signals.

### Instructions
1. Navigate to the `Pulse_Amplitude_Modulation` directory.
2. Open the LABVIEW project file to access the PAM circuit design.
3. Simulate different input signals and observe the corresponding output.

## Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique that controls the width of pulses in a signal. It is widely used in applications like motor control and power electronics.

### Instructions
1. Explore the `Pulse_Width_Modulation` directory.
2. Open the LABVIEW project file to view the PWM circuit design.
3. Experiment with varying pulse widths and observe the effects on the modulated signal.

## Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) is a digital modulation technique that conveys data by changing the phase of two carrier signals. It is commonly used in digital communication systems.

### Instructions
1. Visit the `QPSK` directory.
2. Launch the LABVIEW project file to explore the QPSK circuit design.
3. Modify phase shifts and observe how the data is encoded.

## Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a simple modulation technique that varies the amplitude of a carrier signal to transmit digital data.

### Instructions
1. Find the `Amplitude_Shift_Keying` directory.
2. Open the LABVIEW project file to view the ASK circuit design.
3. Experiment with different amplitude levels for data transmission.

## Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) is a digital modulation technique that changes the frequency of a carrier signal to convey information.

### Instructions
1. Explore the `Frequency_Shift_Keying` directory.
2. Open the LABVIEW project file to access the FSK circuit design.
3. Observe how changing frequencies represent different data states.
